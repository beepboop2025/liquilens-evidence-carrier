# Changelog

All notable source and release changes are recorded here. A version is not
public merely because it appears in this file: the signed GitHub release,
checksums, attestations, and distribution receipts remain the publication
authority.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-08-29

- Assign a new release identity to the post-`v0.15.0` README and deterministic
  MCPB bytes instead of mutating the published `v0.15.0` artifact contract.
- Align Codex plugin discovery with the already-supported, local-only
  four-product Fleet Brief verifier.
- Enforce release-version parity across Python, protocol catalog, MCPB,
  official Registry metadata, and plugin surfaces.
- Replay deterministic MCPB construction before release publication and keep
  the existing offline, read-only, no-financial-authority boundary.

The checksum-pinned MCPB is active/latest in the official MCP Registry; other
distribution channels retain their own independently verified versions.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-08-25

- Published Fleet Brief v1, including local CLI and MCP verification.
- Published the checksum-pinned MCPB and active official MCP Registry record.
- Preserved evidence clocks, rights, product boundaries, and all-false
  execution, recommendation, and credit-rating authority.
